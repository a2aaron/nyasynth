velocity sweep is from 0 to 200 (LMMS units), stepping by 20 each note

cutoff: 0.43 (default)

env mod: 0.0
MEOW: 0.0 sustain
Decay: 1.0 (default)
Attack: 0.48 (default)

peak is around 280hz - 300hz across all velocities


at max velocity, total freq sweep is ~350hz - 8khz over the MEOW env. at zero velocity, total freq sweep is ~350hz constant
